    The last thing I wanted to do on my summer break was blow up another 
school. But there I was Monday morning, the first week of June, sitting in<br/>
my mom’s car in front of Goode High School on East 81st.<br/>
Goode was this big brownstone building overlooking the East River. A<br/>
bunch of BMWs and Lincoln Town Cars were parked out front. Staring up<br/>
at the fancy stone archway, I wondered how long it would take me to get<br/>
kicked out of this place.<br/>
“Just relax.” My mom didn’t sound relaxed. “It’s only an orientation tour.<br/>
And remember, dear, this is Paul’s school. So try not to…you know.”<br/>
“Destroy it?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
Paul Blofis, my mom’s boyfriend, was standing out front, greeting future<br/>
ninth graders as they came up the steps. With his salt-and-pepper hair, denim<br/>
clothes, and leather jacket, he reminded me of a TV actor, but he was just an<br/>
English teacher. He’d managed to convince Goode High School to accept<br/>
me for ninth grade, despite the fact that I’d gotten kicked out of every school<br/>
I’d ever attended. I’d tried to warn him it wasn’t a good idea, but he<br/>
wouldn’t listen.<br/>
I looked at my mom. “You haven’t told him the truth about me, have you?<br/>
She tapped her fingers nervously on the wheel. She was dressed up for a<br/>
job interview—her best blue dress and high-heeled shoes.<br/>
“I thought we should wait,” she admitted.<br/>
“So we don’t scare him away.”<br/>
“I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy, It’s only one morning.”<br/>
“Great,” I mumbled. “I can get expelled before I start the school year.”<br/>
“Think positive. Tomorrow you’re off to camp! After orientation, you’ve<br/>
got your date—”<br/>
“It’s not a date!” I protested. “It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!”<br/>
“She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.”<br/>
“Well, yeah.”<br/>
“You’re going to the movies.”<br/>
“Yeah.”<br/>
“Just the two of you.”<br/>
“Mom!”<br/>
She held up her hands in surrender, but I could tell she was trying hard not
to smile. “You’d better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.”
