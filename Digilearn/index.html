There was a farmer in Africa who was happy and content. He was happy because he
was content. He was content because he wa<br />s happy. One day a wise man came to him
and told him about the glory of diamonds and the power that goes along with them. The
wise man said, "If you had a diamon<br />d the size of your thumb, you could have your own
city. If you had a diamond the size of your fist, you could probably own your own
country." And then he went aw<br />ay. That night the farmer couldn't sleep. He was unhappy
and he was discontent. He was unhappy because he was discontent and discontent
because he was unhappy.<br />
The next morning he made arrangements to sell<br /> off his farm, took care of his family and
went in search of diamonds. He looked all over Africa and couldn't find any. He looked all
through Europe and couldn't find any. When he got to Spain, he was emotionally,
physically and financially broke. He go<br />t so disheartened that he threw himself into the
Barcelona River and committed suicide.
Back home, the person who had bou<br />ght his farm was watering the camels at a stream
that ran through the farm. Across the stream, the rays of the morning sun hit a stone and
made it sparkle like a rainbow. He thought it would look good on the mantle piece. He
picked up the stone and put<br /> it in the living room. That afternoon the wise man came and
saw the stone sparkli<br />ng. He asked, "Is Hafiz back?" The new owner said, "No, why do
you ask?" The w<br />ise man said, "Because that is a diamond. I recognize one when I see
one." The man said, no, that's just a stone I picked up from the stream. Come, I'll show
you. There are many more." They went and picked some samples and sent them for
analysis. Sure enough, the stones were diamonds. They found that the farm was indeed
covered with acres and acres of diamonds.*
What is the moral of this story?
There are five morals:
1. When our attitude is right, we realize that we are all walking on acres and acres of
diamonds.<br />
RokZRooM Specia<br />l ! You Can Win by Shiv Khera
10 of 177<br />
• Attributed to Dr Russel Conwell <br />.
• Opportunity is always unde<br />r our feet. We don't have to go anywhere. All we need
to do is recognize it.<br />
2. The grass on the<br /> other side always looks greener.
3. While we are dyeing the grass on the other side, there are others who are dyeing the
grass on our <br />side. They would be happy to trade places with us.
4. When people don't know how to recognize opportunity, they complain of noise when it
knocks.<br />
5. The same opportunity never knocks twice. The next one may be better or worse, but it
is never the same one.<br />
DAVID AND GOLIATH<br />
We all know the story of David and Goliath. There was a giant who was bullying and
harassing the children in the village. One day, a 17-year-old shepherd boy came to visit
his brothers and asked, "Why don't you stand up and fight the giant?" The brothers were
terrified and they replied, "Don't you see he is too big to hit?" But David said, "No, he is
not too big to hit, he is too big to miss." The rest is history. We all know what happened.
David killed the giant with a sling. Same giant, different perception.<br />
Our attitude determines how we look at a setback. To a positive thinker, it can be a
stepping stone to success. To a negative thinker, it can be a stumbling block.
Great organizations are not measured by wages and working conditions, they are
measured by feelings, attitudes and relationships.
When employees say, "I can't do it," there are two possible meanings. Are they saying
they don't know how to or they don't want to? If they don't know how to, that is a training
issue. If they are saying they don't want to,
it may be an attitude issue (they don't care) or a values issue (they believe they should
not do it).<br /><br /><br />
